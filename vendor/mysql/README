DLL files can be found in "Shared/data/MTA San Andreas/server".
That directory gets copied to the "Bin" directory when you run "win-install-data.bat".

The source code for MySQL and OpenSSL used to produce the binaries can be found here:
https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/releases/tag/mysql-8.3.0
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/tag/openssl-3.2.1
